Just had some inspiration tonight on a new logo for the ***brand***.

I drew it up on the whiteboard and sent it down to graphic design to get me some initial samples. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, the graphic design team is on strike... So I had to throw one together my self using [~~MS~~ JS Paint](https://jspaint.app). It's such an intuitive and straightforward tool, can't understand why they wanted this "[Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)" thing.

Not too shabby if I say so myself. It has potential. More to come.
