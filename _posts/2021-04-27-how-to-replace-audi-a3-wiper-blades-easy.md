# Intro
Quick post on how to replace the wipers in your Audi A3. It’s very easy to do and only takes a few minutes. I didn’t see a great tutorial on YouTube so I decided to make my own!

While I wrote this specifically for an Audi A3 8V, [these exact wipers](https://amzn.to/3pIypq5) also fit on: 
* **Audi** A3 Limousine (8V) 2013+
  - RS3 Limousine (8V) 2017+
  - S3 Limousine (8V) 2013+
* **Porsche** Panamera (970) 2013-2016
* **Tesla** Model 3 2016+
* **Volkswagen** Arteon (3H7) 2017+
  - Passat (3G2) 2014+
  - Passat (CB2) 2019+
  - Passat Alltrack (3G5) 2015+
  - Passat Variant (3G5) 2014+
  - Passat Variant (CB5) 2019+
  - T-Roc 2017+
* **Ssangyong** Musso (Q200) 2018+

# [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR)
1. Buy replacement wipers (Bosch Aerotwin A102S’s):
  - [FCP Euro ($24 + shipping)](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/audi-vw-wiper-blade-set-bosch-8v1998002a)
  - [Amazon $38 (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/3pIypq5)
1. Put the wipers into “service position”
  - Push the wiper stalk (right of steering wheel) down and hold. Might have to turn the ignition on and then off to "wake up" the car for this to work
1. Take the old wipers off
  - Pull the wipers up, off of the windshield, push button, lift up
1. Put the new wipers on
  - Push down until you hear a click
1. Push down on the wiper stalk to take them out of "service position"

# Buy replacement wipers
I used the Bosch Aerotwin A102S's. I got mine from FCP Euro for [$24 + shipping](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/audi-vw-wiper-blade-set-bosch-8v1998002a). I ordered a few other things (cabin and engine air filters - additional post on those coming soon!) as they have free shipping for orders >$49. You can also find these wipers on Amazon for [$38 (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/3pIypq5). You might even be able to use something else as long as it has 19"/475mm passenger wipers and 26"/650mm driver side wipers.
