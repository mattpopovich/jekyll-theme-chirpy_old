## Intro
Quick post on how to replace the wipers in your Audi A3. It’s very easy to do and only takes a few minutes. I didn’t see a great tutorial on YouTube so I decided to make my own!

While I wrote this specifically for a [2015 Audi A3 8V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A3#Third_generation_(Typ_8V;_2013)), [these wipers](https://amzn.to/3pIypq5) will also fit on: 
* **Audi** A3 Limousine (8V) 2013+
  - RS3 Limousine (8V) 2017+
  - S3 Limousine (8V) 2013+
* **Porsche** Panamera (970) 2013-2016
* **Tesla** Model 3 2016+
* **Volkswagen** Arteon (3H7) 2017+
  - Passat (3G2) 2014+
  - Passat (CB2) 2019+
  - Passat Alltrack (3G5) 2015+
  - Passat Variant (3G5) 2014+
  - Passat Variant (CB5) 2019+
  - T-Roc 2017+

## [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR)
1. Buy replacement wipers (Bosch Aerotwin A102S’s):
  - [FCP Euro ($24 + shipping)](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/audi-vw-wiper-blade-set-bosch-8v1998002a)
  - [Amazon $38 (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/3pIypq5)
1. Put the wipers into “service position”
  - Push the wiper stalk (right of steering wheel) down and hold. Might have to turn the ignition on and then off to "wake up" the car for this to work
1. Take the old wipers off
  - Pull the wipers up, off of the windshield, push button, lift up
1. Put the new wipers on
  - Push down until you hear a click
1. Push down on the wiper stalk to take them out of "service position"

## Buy replacement wipers
I used the Bosch Aerotwin A102S's. I got mine from FCP Euro for [$24 + shipping](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/audi-vw-wiper-blade-set-bosch-8v1998002a). I ordered a few other things (cabin and engine air filters - additional post on those coming soon!) as they have free shipping for orders >$49. You can also find these wipers on Amazon for [$38 (affiliate link)](https://amzn.to/3pIypq5). You might even be able to use something else that has the same size: 19"/475mm passenger wipers and 26"/650mm driver side wipers.

## Put the wipers into “service position”
If you'll notice, you can't get to the wipers very easily. You can't lift them up without hitting the hood (or, bonnet, for those British folk) of the car. We can solve that by putting the wipers into "service position". 

To put the wipers into _service position_, you'll need to pull the wiper stalk (right of the steering wheel) down (to position 4) and hold it there for a few seconds. Your wipers will then move halfway up the windshield and stay there. If this does not work, you'll need to "wake up" the vehicle by turning the ignition on and then off, then pull the wiper stalk down to position 4 and hold it there for a few seconds. 

Once the wipers are up into service position, you can lift them up off of the windshield to get them into a position to work on. Just note that once you take the old wipers off, be careful to not let the wipers go back onto the windshield as they will scratch the windshield up if the wipers are not on.
